Introduction for Potential Employer

Lambda is a tool and coding element for Amazon AWS that allows you to create 
functions and edit codes inside the functions in order to put out commands and follow directions. 
In class, we created multiple Lambda functions to carryout everyday useful tasks and we 
allocated these tasks to make life simpler. It is a very useful tool that can be tweaked and edited 
to the users liking. The functions also allow you to check logs and do all sorts of other interesting 
and useful things in order to make your time management more efficient.

SQS is a tool and coding element for Amazon AWS that allows the user to create a 
Simple Queue Service for receiving and sending messages. This is a useful tool to send and 
receive messages and for testing these purposes. You can use this service along with another tool 
we will talk about later, called SES. The SQS service allows you to create code and allocate that 
code to Lambda to carry out functions related to sending and receiving emails, messages, and 
other things. This function is very useful for testing messaging capabilities through Amazon 
AWS.

SES is another tool used for coding and functional development through Amazon AWS. 
This coding function allows the user to add additional steps and functions in order to create an 
email-like simulation that allows the code to flow through a verified email address to send to a 
user of your choice, and the emails must be attached through Amazon in order for this function 
to work properly. This is a great choice and strarting point for other useful things like email 
sending, receiving, and testing out the way these things work together to produce an end effect.

Restful api is an api, or an application programming interface, that allows you to connect 
different points together in order to create a server like simulation. This api is used in computing 
and coding to allow you to add more complexity to your functions. This is a very useful tool 
from Amazon AWS that can help you create multiple interfaces and instances to get your work 
done. Once this step is complete you can have multiple tasks working on one another at one 
given time and this api can be made to be very powerful to help you out and help run on its own. 
This is very useful if you need something done at a certain time or a certain way, especially if 
you are not available to complete the code manually. You can add this restful api to SQS or SES 
like we did in class. We sent the email to ourselves to see the top big movers every single day 
MON-FRI at 8:30 A.M. and 9:00 A.M.

The project scope for this class and all of these tools were designed and allocated for us 
to help us learn more about Amazon AWS and the coding world. I had a lot of fun understanding 
and learning more about code and functionalities in this course and these assignments have 
helped me a lot. The best part about this assignment, I believe, is the way the course prepared us 
with real life functionalities and helped us understand many parts of Amazon AWS, including 
Lambda. I had a lot of fun doing these tests and projects and have a great understanding of how 
they work now.
